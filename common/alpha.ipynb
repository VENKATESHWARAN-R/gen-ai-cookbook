      "**Document Doc1**: Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to perform computations at speeds unattainable by classical computers. It relies on principles like superposition, where quantum bits (qubits) exist in multiple states simultaneously, and entanglement, which enables qubits to be linked regardless of distance. These properties allow quantum computers to solve complex problems efficiently. Current research is focused on improving qubit stability and error correction.\n",
      "**Document Doc2**: The theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, revolutionized our understanding of space and time. It consists of special relativity, which deals with objects moving at high velocities, and general relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime. This theory has been experimentally confirmed through observations like gravitational lensing and time dilation. Modern GPS systems rely on relativity corrections for accurate positioning.\n",
      "**Document Doc3**: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. It includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques. These models are used in applications like image recognition, fraud detection, and recommendation systems. The effectiveness of a machine learning model depends on the quality and quantity of training data.\n",
      "**Document Doc4**: Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and secure way to record transactions. It uses cryptographic hashing and distributed consensus to ensure data integrity. Originally developed for Bitcoin, blockchain is now used in supply chain management, digital identity, and smart contracts. The technology faces challenges like scalability and energy consumption.\n",
      "**Document Doc5**: The human brain consists of billions of neurons that communicate through electrical and chemical signals. Neural networks in artificial intelligence are inspired by this biological structure. The brain's plasticity allows it to adapt and learn new information throughout life. Research in neuroscience is uncovering new treatments for cognitive disorders.\n",

It consists of special relativity, which deals with objects moving at high velocities, and general relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime. This theory has been experimentally confirmed through observations like gravitational lensing and time dilation. Modern GPS systems rely on relativity corrections for accurate positioning.\n",
      "**Document Doc3**: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. It includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques. These models are used in applications like image recognition, fraud detection, and recommendation systems. The effectiveness of a machine learning model depends on the quality and quantity of training data.\n",
      "**Document Doc4**: Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and secure way to record transactions. It uses cryptographic hashing and distributed consensus to ensure data integrity. Originally developed for Bitcoin, blockchain is now used in supply chain management, digital identity, and smart contracts. The technology faces challenges like scalability and energy consumption.\n",
      "**Document Doc5**: The human brain consists of billions of neurons that communicate through electrical and chemical signals. Neural networks in artificial intelligence are inspired by this biological structure. The brain's plasticity allows it to adapt and learn new information throughout life. Research in neuroscience is uncovering new treatments for cognitive disorders.\n",

      "Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to perform computations at speeds unattainable by classical computers. It relies on principles like superposition, where quantum bits (qubits) exist in multiple states simultaneously, and entanglement, which enables qubits to be linked regardless of distance (Doc1). Current research is focused on improving qubit stability and error correction (Doc1).<end_of_turn>\n",
